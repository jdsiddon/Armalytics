## Data ##

This data comes from the The ADXL345. ADXL345 is a digital accelerometer that supports both SPI and I2C mode, with adjustable data rata and 'range' (+/-2/4/8/16g).  The Adafruit_ADXL345 driver takes advantage of I2C mode to reduce the total pin count required to use the sensor.

More information on the ADXL345 can be found in the datasheet: http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/data_sheets/ADXL345.pdf
